# NewsClassifier: Building an Automated News Classification System with NLP Techniques

## Overview

Building a news classification system involves several steps, including web scraping, data preprocessing, and model training. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles into different topics.

## Project Structure

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - Choose news websites (e.g., BBC, The Hindu, Times Now, CNN) and use web scraping tools or libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Selenium) to extract news articles.
   - Retrieve the title and content of each news article. Ensure a diverse dataset covering various topics.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Remove irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, advertisements, or non-text content.
   - Tokenize the text, remove stop words, perform lemmatization or stemming, and handle missing data to ensure a consistent format.

3. **Text Representation:**
   - Convert the text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
   - Techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
   - Consider using pre-trained word embeddings for improved performance.

4. **Topic Clustering:**
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) on preprocessed text data to group similar articles together.
   - Choose the number of clusters based on the topics you want to identify (e.g., Sports, Business, Politics, Weather).

5. **Topic Labeling:**
   - Manually inspect a sample of articles in each cluster to assign topic labels. This step helps label clusters with meaningful topics.

6. **Classification Model:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a supervised machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models like LSTM or BERT) to predict the topic of a news article.
   - Use labeled clusters as ground truth labels for training the model.

7. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of your classification model on the testing set using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Fine-tune model parameters if needed to improve performance.

8. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy a classification application using Streamlit.
